## Reflection

1.  How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?

I used push() to add items to an array.  I did not use filter(); I am familiar with Array methods and chose not to use it, though if I had, I could have used it similarly to the control flow loop I wrote (use .toLowerCase() to make search term case-insensitive.)

2.  What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?

I faced no particular challenges.


3.  How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?

The code is efficient and user-friendly considering assignment specifications.  Were I to to change user specifications, I would add things like adding ability to input quantity and price, consolidating items based on case-insensitive alphabetization, alphabetizing list as input, or possibly storing data in a Map for faster access speeds, presenting subtotals, adding ability to edit or remove items in cart regardless of order, and so on.
