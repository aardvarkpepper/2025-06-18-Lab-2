## Reflection

Note:  Tasks 1 and 2 are in script.js, along with commented-out code for testing.  Uncomment code and enter "node script.js" in bash or terminal to execute.

1.  How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?

I used push() to add items to an array.  I did not use filter(); I am familiar with Array methods and chose not to use it, though if I had, I could have used it similarly to the control flow loop I wrote (use .toLowerCase() to make search term case-insensitive.)

2.  What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?

I faced no particular challenges.


3.  How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?

The code is efficient and user-friendly considering assignment specifications.  Were I to to change user specifications, I would add things like adding ability to input quantity and price, consolidating items based on case-insensitive alphabetization, alphabetizing list as input, or possibly storing data in a Map for faster access speeds, presenting subtotals, adding ability to edit or remove items in cart regardless of order, and so on.
